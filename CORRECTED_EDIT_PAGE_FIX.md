# 🔧 Corrected Edit Facility Page Fixes

## 🐛 **Issues Identified:**

### **Issue 1: Hot Reload on Alt+Tab**
**Problem**: Edit facility page was reloading every time user alt+tabbed away and back
**Root Cause**: `loadFacility` function was being recreated on every render, causing useEffect to trigger

### **Issue 2: Approved Sections Not Showing as Approved**
**Problem**: Edit page was showing all sections as pending instead of preserving approved statuses
**Root Cause**: Edit page was using `.single()` instead of getting the most recent review

### **Issue 3: Incorrect Auto-Resubmit Behavior**
**Problem**: Previous fix automatically resubmitted for review when saving changes
**Requirement**: Users should just save changes, then manually use resubmit button when ready

## ✅ **Corrected Fixes Applied:**

### **Fix 1: Stabilize loadFacility Function**
```typescript
// BEFORE: Function recreated on every render
const loadFacility = async () => {
  // ... function body
}

useEffect(() => {
  if (!user || !facilityUser) {
    router.push('/login')
    return
  }
  loadFacility()
}, [user, facilityUser, facilityId, router])

// AFTER: Stable function with useCallback
const loadFacility = useCallback(async () => {
  // ... function body
}, [facilityId, facilityUser?.id])

useEffect(() => {
  if (!user || !facilityUser) {
    router.push('/login')
    return
  }
  loadFacility()
}, [user, facilityUser, router, loadFacility])
```

### **Fix 2: Get Most Recent Review (Already Fixed)**
```typescript
// Gets the most recent review to show correct statuses
const { data: reviewData } = await supabase
  .from('facility_reviews')
  .select('*')
  .eq('facility_id', facilityId)
  .order('updated_at', { ascending: false })
  .limit(1)
  .single()
```

### **Fix 3: Remove Auto-Resubmit (Corrected)**
```typescript
// REMOVED: Automatic resubmit logic
// Now just saves facility data and shows success message
await updateFacilityFeatures(facilityId, formData.features)
setMessage('✅ Facility updated successfully!')
```

## 🎯 **Expected Behavior After Corrected Fixes:**

### **Edit Page Stability:**
1. ✅ **No hot reload** when alt+tabbing away and back
2. ✅ **Stable interface** that doesn't refresh unnecessarily
3. ✅ **Smooth user experience** without interruptions

### **Review Status Display:**
1. ✅ **Approved sections show as approved** with green background and checkmark
2. ✅ **Rejected sections show feedback** with red background and admin comments
3. ✅ **Correct visual indicators** for all review statuses

### **Save Changes Workflow:**
1. **User edits facility** → Makes changes to address feedback
2. **User clicks "Save Changes"** → Facility data is updated
3. ✅ **No automatic resubmit** → User stays in control
4. **User returns to dashboard** → Can use resubmit button when ready
5. ✅ **Resubmit button works** → Preserves approved statuses when used

## 🧪 **Test Scenarios:**

### **Test 1: Edit Page Stability**
1. User opens edit facility page
2. Alt+tabs to another application
3. Alt+tabs back to browser
4. ✅ Edit page should NOT reload/flash

### **Test 2: Review Status Display**
1. Admin approves some sections, rejects others
2. User goes to edit facility page
3. ✅ User should see:
   - Approved sections: Green background with checkmark
   - Rejected sections: Red background with feedback
   - Correct status text and icons

### **Test 3: Save Without Auto-Resubmit**
1. User makes changes on edit page
2. User clicks "Save Changes"
3. ✅ Should happen:
   - Facility data updated
   - Success message shown
   - Redirect to dashboard
   - NO automatic resubmission
4. User can then manually use resubmit button on dashboard

### **Test 4: Manual Resubmit Preserves Approvals**
1. User saves changes on edit page
2. User returns to dashboard
3. User clicks "Resubmit for Review" button
4. ✅ Should preserve approved statuses from previous review

## 🎉 **System Now Works Correctly!**

The edit facility page now:
- **Stable interface** without hot reloads
- **Shows correct review statuses** from most recent review
- **Saves changes only** without automatic resubmission
- **Allows manual control** over when to resubmit for review
- **Preserves approved work** when resubmit button is used

Both dashboard and edit page are now fully functional with proper review status preservation! 🚀
