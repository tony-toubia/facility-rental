# Admin Page Fixes - Complete! ✅

## 🐛 **Issue Identified**
The admin page was showing the error:
```
❌ Error loading facilities: column facility_amenities_1.amenity_name does not exist
```

## 🔧 **Root Causes & Fixes Applied**

### 1. **Column Name Mismatch** ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: The admin page was trying to access `amenity_name` and `feature_name` columns, but the actual database schema uses `name` for both tables.

**Fix Applied**:
- Updated query in `app/admin/page.tsx` to use correct column names:
  ```sql
  facility_amenities (name)  -- was: amenity_name
  facility_features (name)   -- was: feature_name
  ```
- Fixed TypeScript interfaces to match database schema
- Updated display code to use `amenity.name` and `feature.name`

### 2. **Missing Authentication** ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: The admin page wasn't properly authenticated, causing RLS policies to block database queries.

**Fix Applied**:
- Added `useAuth` hook to check authentication
- Added redirect to login page if not authenticated
- Added loading state while checking authentication
- Updated queries to only run when user is authenticated

### 3. **RLS Policy Issues** ⚠️ NEEDS SQL SCRIPT
**Problem**: Row Level Security policies may be blocking admin access to facilities.

**Fix Available**: Run the `sql/fix-admin-access.sql` script in your Supabase SQL editor to:
- Allow authenticated users to view all facilities (for admin review)
- Allow authenticated users to manage reviews
- Ensure all related tables are accessible

## 📁 **Files Modified**

### `app/admin/page.tsx`
```typescript
// Added authentication
import { useAuth } from '@/lib/auth'
const { user, loading: authLoading } = useAuth()

// Fixed column names in query
facility_amenities (name)    // was: amenity_name
facility_features (name)     // was: feature_name

// Fixed TypeScript interfaces
facility_amenities?: { name: string }[]  // was: amenity_name
facility_features?: { name: string }[]   // was: feature_name

// Fixed display code
{amenity.name}    // was: amenity.name
{feature.name}    // was: feature.name

// Added authentication checks
if (authLoading) return <LoadingSpinner />
if (!user) return null
```

## 🚀 **Next Steps**

### 1. **Run SQL Script** (Required)
Execute the `sql/fix-admin-access.sql` script in your Supabase SQL editor to fix RLS policies.

### 2. **Test Admin Access**
1. Make sure you're logged in (go to `/login` first)
2. Navigate to `/admin`
3. You should now see facilities pending review

### 3. **Create Test Data** (Optional)
If you don't have any facilities to review:
1. Use the "Testing" tab in the admin panel
2. Click "Create Sample Facility"
3. The facility will be created with `pending_approval` status

## 🔍 **Debugging Tools Created**

### `sql/debug-admin-access.sql`
Run this script to debug any remaining issues:
- Check if facilities exist in database
- Check current RLS policies
- Test queries without RLS
- Verify table structure

### `sql/fix-admin-access.sql`
Run this script to fix RLS policies for admin access.

## ✅ **Expected Result**

After applying these fixes and running the SQL script, the admin page should:
1. ✅ Load without column errors
2. ✅ Show facilities with `pending_approval` or `needs_changes` status
3. ✅ Display amenities and features correctly
4. ✅ Allow admins to review and provide feedback
5. ✅ Enable the complete review workflow

## 🔐 **Security Notes**

The RLS policies have been updated to allow authenticated users to access facilities for admin purposes. In a production environment, you may want to:
1. Create a specific admin role
2. Restrict admin access to users with that role
3. Add additional security checks

For now, any authenticated user can access the admin panel, which is suitable for development and testing.
