# ðŸ”§ Three Critical Fixes Applied

## âœ… **1. Fixed Constant Reloading Issue**

**Problem**: Dashboard was reloading constantly when alt+tabbing
**Root Cause**: `selectedFacility` was in the `loadFacilities` dependency array
**Fix**: Removed `selectedFacility` from the useCallback dependencies

```typescript
// BEFORE (caused infinite reloads)
const loadFacilities = useCallback(async () => {
  // ...
}, [facilityUser?.id, user?.id, selectedFacility])

// AFTER (stable)
const loadFacilities = useCallback(async () => {
  // ...
}, [facilityUser?.id, user?.id])
```

## âœ… **2. Hide Resubmit Button After Resubmission**

**Problem**: Resubmit button was still showing when status was `pending_approval`
**Root Cause**: FacilityReviewFeedback was showing for both `needs_changes` AND `pending_approval`
**Fix**: Only show FacilityReviewFeedback when status is `needs_changes`

```typescript
// BEFORE (showed resubmit button even after resubmission)
{(selectedFacility.status === 'needs_changes' || selectedFacility.status === 'pending_approval') && (
  <FacilityReviewFeedback ... />
)}

// AFTER (only shows when changes are actually needed)
{selectedFacility.status === 'needs_changes' && (
  <FacilityReviewFeedback ... />
)}
```

## âœ… **3. Preserve Approved Section Statuses**

**Problem**: All sections were reset to `pending` on resubmission, even previously approved ones
**Root Cause**: Database function was resetting ALL sections instead of just rejected ones
**Fix**: Updated `resubmit_facility_for_review()` function to preserve approved statuses

```sql
-- BEFORE (reset everything to pending)
'pending',

-- AFTER (preserve approved, only reset rejected)
CASE WHEN current_review.basic_info_status = 'needs_changes' 
     THEN 'pending' 
     ELSE COALESCE(current_review.basic_info_status, 'pending') 
END,
```

## ðŸš€ **How to Apply These Fixes**

### **1. Code Changes (Already Applied)**
- âœ… Dashboard reloading fix
- âœ… Resubmit button visibility fix

### **2. Database Update Required**
Run the updated `database_updates_clean.sql` or just the function update:

```sql
-- Run this in Supabase SQL Editor to update the resubmit function
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION resubmit_facility_for_review(facility_id_param UUID)
RETURNS BOOLEAN AS $$
DECLARE
    current_review RECORD;
BEGIN
    -- Get the current review
    SELECT * INTO current_review 
    FROM facility_reviews 
    WHERE facility_id = facility_id_param 
    ORDER BY updated_at DESC 
    LIMIT 1;
    
    -- Update facility status to pending_approval
    UPDATE facility_facilities 
    SET status = 'pending_approval', updated_at = NOW()
    WHERE id = facility_id_param;
    
    -- Create new review record with previous review reference
    -- Only reset sections that were previously rejected (needs_changes)
    IF current_review.id IS NOT NULL THEN
        INSERT INTO facility_reviews (
            facility_id, status, basic_info_status, basic_info_comments,
            description_status, description_comments, location_status, location_comments,
            pricing_status, pricing_comments, amenities_status, amenities_comments,
            features_status, features_comments, images_status, images_comments,
            policies_status, policies_comments, availability_status, availability_comments,
            general_comments, previous_review_id
        ) VALUES (
            facility_id_param, 'pending',
            -- Only reset to pending if it was previously needs_changes, otherwise keep approved
            CASE WHEN current_review.basic_info_status = 'needs_changes' THEN 'pending' ELSE COALESCE(current_review.basic_info_status, 'pending') END,
            CASE WHEN current_review.basic_info_status = 'needs_changes' THEN current_review.basic_info_comments ELSE '' END,
            CASE WHEN current_review.description_status = 'needs_changes' THEN 'pending' ELSE COALESCE(current_review.description_status, 'pending') END,
            CASE WHEN current_review.description_status = 'needs_changes' THEN current_review.description_comments ELSE '' END,
            CASE WHEN current_review.location_status = 'needs_changes' THEN 'pending' ELSE COALESCE(current_review.location_status, 'pending') END,
            CASE WHEN current_review.location_status = 'needs_changes' THEN current_review.location_comments ELSE '' END,
            CASE WHEN current_review.pricing_status = 'needs_changes' THEN 'pending' ELSE COALESCE(current_review.pricing_status, 'pending') END,
            CASE WHEN current_review.pricing_status = 'needs_changes' THEN current_review.pricing_comments ELSE '' END,
            CASE WHEN current_review.amenities_status = 'needs_changes' THEN 'pending' ELSE COALESCE(current_review.amenities_status, 'pending') END,
            CASE WHEN current_review.amenities_status = 'needs_changes' THEN current_review.amenities_comments ELSE '' END,
            CASE WHEN current_review.features_status = 'needs_changes' THEN 'pending' ELSE COALESCE(current_review.features_status, 'pending') END,
            CASE WHEN current_review.features_status = 'needs_changes' THEN current_review.features_comments ELSE '' END,
            CASE WHEN current_review.images_status = 'needs_changes' THEN 'pending' ELSE COALESCE(current_review.images_status, 'pending') END,
            CASE WHEN current_review.images_status = 'needs_changes' THEN current_review.images_comments ELSE '' END,
            CASE WHEN current_review.policies_status = 'needs_changes' THEN 'pending' ELSE COALESCE(current_review.policies_status, 'pending') END,
            CASE WHEN current_review.policies_status = 'needs_changes' THEN current_review.policies_comments ELSE '' END,
            CASE WHEN current_review.availability_status = 'needs_changes' THEN 'pending' ELSE COALESCE(current_review.availability_status, 'pending') END,
            CASE WHEN current_review.availability_status = 'needs_changes' THEN current_review.availability_comments ELSE '' END,
            current_review.general_comments,
            current_review.id
        );
    END IF;
    
    RETURN TRUE;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```

## ðŸŽ¯ **Expected Behavior After Fixes**

### **Dashboard Experience:**
1. âœ… **No More Constant Reloading** - Alt+tab works normally
2. âœ… **Clean Status Flow** - Resubmit button disappears after resubmission
3. âœ… **Proper Status Display** - Shows "Pending Approval" when appropriate

### **Admin Review Experience:**
1. âœ… **Efficient Reviews** - Only rejected sections need re-review
2. âœ… **Preserved Approvals** - Previously approved sections stay approved
3. âœ… **Clear History** - Can see what was changed vs what was already approved

### **Complete Workflow:**
1. **Initial Review** â†’ Admin approves some sections, rejects others
2. **User Edits** â†’ Makes changes to rejected sections only
3. **Resubmission** â†’ Status changes to pending_approval, resubmit button disappears
4. **Re-Review** â†’ Admin only needs to review previously rejected sections
5. **Final Approval** â†’ Much faster since approved sections weren't reset

This creates a much more efficient and user-friendly review process! ðŸš€
