# Review System Integration - Complete! ✅

## 🎯 **Integration Summary**

The detailed admin review system has been successfully integrated into your facility management pages. Here's what was completed:

### ✅ **Completed Integrations:**

#### 1. **Dashboard Page** (`/app/dashboard/page.tsx`)
- **Location**: Main facility management dashboard
- **Integration**: Replaced basic "Changes Needed" alert with detailed `FacilityReviewFeedback` component
- **Triggers**: Shows for facilities with status `needs_changes` or `pending_approval`
- **Features**: 
  - Detailed section-by-section feedback
  - One-click resubmission
  - Real-time status updates

#### 2. **FacilityReviewStatus Component** (`/components/FacilityReviewStatus.tsx`)
- **Purpose**: Reusable component for showing facility review status
- **Integration**: Updated to use the new detailed feedback component
- **Usage**: Can be imported and used in any page that needs to show facility review status

### 🔧 **How It Works:**

1. **Admin Reviews Facility**: Admin provides detailed feedback on `/admin` page
2. **Facility Owner Sees Feedback**: Owner sees detailed feedback in dashboard
3. **Owner Makes Changes**: Owner updates their facility based on feedback
4. **One-Click Resubmit**: Owner clicks "Resubmit for Review" button
5. **Status Updates**: Facility status changes to `pending_approval`

### 📁 **Files Modified:**

1. **`/app/dashboard/page.tsx`**
   - Added import for `FacilityReviewFeedback`
   - Replaced basic status alerts with detailed feedback component
   - Connected resubmit callback to refresh facility list

2. **`/components/FacilityReviewStatus.tsx`**
   - Added import for `FacilityReviewFeedback`
   - Replaced complex manual feedback display with reusable component
   - Simplified code while maintaining all functionality

### 🚀 **Usage Examples:**

#### In Dashboard (Already Integrated):
```tsx
{(selectedFacility.status === 'needs_changes' || selectedFacility.status === 'pending_approval') && (
  <FacilityReviewFeedback
    facilityId={selectedFacility.id}
    facilityName={selectedFacility.name}
    facilityStatus={selectedFacility.status}
    onResubmit={loadFacilities}
  />
)}
```

#### Using FacilityReviewStatus Component:
```tsx
import FacilityReviewStatus from '@/components/FacilityReviewStatus'

// In any page where you want to show facility review status:
<FacilityReviewStatus />
```

#### Using the Hook Directly:
```tsx
import { useFacilityReview } from '@/hooks/useFacilityReview'

const { review, hasChangesRequested, resubmitForReview } = useFacilityReview(facilityId)

if (hasChangesRequested()) {
  // Show feedback UI
}
```

### 🎨 **UI Features:**

- **Status Indicators**: Clear visual indicators for each section (Pending/Approved/Needs Changes)
- **Section-by-Section Feedback**: Organized feedback for 8 different facility sections
- **Smart Resubmit Button**: Only shows when facility needs changes
- **Real-time Updates**: Status updates immediately after resubmission
- **Responsive Design**: Works on all screen sizes

### 🔒 **Security:**

- **RLS Policies**: Facility owners can only see reviews for their own facilities
- **Function Security**: Resubmit function validates ownership before allowing changes
- **Admin Controls**: Only authenticated users can manage reviews (admin role to be added later)

### 📊 **Database Integration:**

- **Review Storage**: All feedback stored in `facility_reviews` table
- **Status Tracking**: Facility status automatically updated via database triggers
- **Audit Trail**: Full history of review changes with timestamps

## 🎉 **Ready to Use!**

The review system is now fully integrated and ready for use. Facility owners will see detailed feedback in their dashboard, and can easily resubmit their facilities after making changes.

### Next Steps (Optional):
1. **Add Admin Role Check**: Implement proper admin role validation
2. **Email Notifications**: Send emails when status changes
3. **Review History**: Show history of all reviews for a facility
4. **Bulk Actions**: Allow admins to approve/reject multiple facilities at once
