# 🎯 Browse Page & Booking Module Improvements

## ✅ **Changes Completed**

### **1. Browse Page - Removed Duplicate Category Display**

**Issue**: Category was displayed twice - once above facility name and again as badges/pills below.

**Solution**: Removed the category text above facility name, keeping only the category badges/pills.

**File**: `app/browse/page.tsx`
- **Before**: `<span className="text-sm text-primary-600 font-medium">{facility.type}</span>` above facility name
- **After**: Removed the span, kept only the rating display aligned to the right

**Benefits**:
- ✅ **Cleaner design** - no duplicate information
- ✅ **Better visual hierarchy** - facility name is more prominent
- ✅ **Consistent with badges** - categories shown as styled pills below

### **2. Facility Detail Page - Login Required for Booking**

**Issue**: Anyone could interact with booking module without being logged in.

**Solution**: Added authentication check with call-to-action for non-logged-in users.

**File**: `app/facility/[id]/page.tsx`
- **Added**: `useAuth` hook import and usage
- **Added**: Conditional rendering based on user authentication status
- **Added**: Login call-to-action component with Sign In and Create Account buttons

**New Login CTA Features**:
- 🔐 **Login icon** with clear messaging
- 📝 **Two action buttons** - Sign In and Create Account
- 💰 **Price display** - shows starting price even when not logged in
- 🎨 **Professional styling** - matches existing design system

### **3. Booking Module - Only Show Available Dates**

**Issue**: All dates were shown regardless of availability.

**Solution**: Enhanced date filtering to only show dates with available time slots.

**File**: `components/BookingAvailability.tsx`
- **Added**: `loadAllAvailability()` function to load availability for all dates upfront
- **Modified**: Date filtering logic to check for available time slots
- **Enhanced**: Availability data processing for 30-day period

**Implementation**:
```typescript
// Filter dates to only show those with available time slots
const dateOptions = allDateOptions.filter(dateOption => {
  const dateAvailability = availability.find(a => a.availability_date === dateOption.value)
  return dateAvailability?.time_slots.some(slot => slot.is_available) || availability.length === 0
})
```

### **4. Changed "Select Time" to "Start Time"**

**Issue**: Label was confusing since duration is selected separately.

**Solution**: Updated label to be more accurate.

**File**: `components/BookingAvailability.tsx`
- **Before**: `Select Time`
- **After**: `Start Time`

**Benefits**:
- ✅ **More accurate** - reflects that this is the start time
- ✅ **Clearer workflow** - start time + duration = booking period
- ✅ **Better UX** - users understand they're selecting when to start

---

### **5. Dynamic Duration Options Based on Facility Settings**

**Issue**: Duration options were hardcoded and didn't respect facility settings.

**Solution**: Generated duration options based on minimum duration and increment settings.

**File**: `components/BookingAvailability.tsx`
- **Added**: `generateDurationOptions()` function
- **Logic**: Uses `minimumRentalDuration` and `availabilityIncrement` from facility settings
- **Range**: From minimum duration up to 8 hours in facility-defined increments

**Implementation**:
```typescript
const generateDurationOptions = () => {
  const options = []
  const minDuration = minimumRentalDuration || availabilityIncrement
  const increment = availabilityIncrement
  
  // Generate options from minimum duration up to 8 hours in increments
  for (let duration = minDuration; duration <= 480; duration += increment) {
    options.push(duration)
  }
  
  return options
}
```

### **6. Removed "(minutes)" from Duration Label**

**Issue**: Label was cluttered with unnecessary text.

**Solution**: Simplified the label.

**File**: `components/BookingAvailability.tsx`
- **Before**: `Duration (minutes)`
- **After**: `Duration`

**Benefits**:
- ✅ **Cleaner interface** - less visual clutter
- ✅ **Options show units** - dropdown options still show "minutes" or "hours"
- ✅ **More professional** - follows modern UI patterns
